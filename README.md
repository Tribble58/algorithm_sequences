### Repository for test case "Algorithm Sequences"

Before running the script, please make sure you read the documentation that describes the solution

Here are the paths for essential files:

* /others/documentation.txt - documentation
* /src/main.py - py script that results in information for the dashboard and represents the solution for
  the task
* /output/dashboardTableau.pdf - dashboard with all desired information
* /src/main_ex.py - extended py script (see the documentation, paragraph 4)
* /src/requirements.txt - requirement python packages for correct script execution

**Place all your data in _/data_ directory before running the main script**

Install all packages from requirements.txt prior to running the script

    pip install -r src/requirements.txt

To execute the script, proceed to the _/src_ folder and run

    python main.py

Or run it through your IDE
